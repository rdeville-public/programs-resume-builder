            ##### Description {.subtitle}

            Within the platform development team of the LIRIS, I designed and
            implement an experimentation platform dedicated to research projects.


            This platform will allows researchers to easily deploy and run their
            experiments on large-scale computer clusters and gather reproducible
            results.


            This project is called PAGoDA, which stands for
            **P**lateforme à base de plugins pour les **A**pplication bi**G**
            **D**ata **A**nalytics (Plugins based platform for big data
            analytics applications).

            ##### Responsibilities {.subtitle}

            Regarding the __[PAGoDA][pagoda]__ platform project, my main
            activities were:


              - Hardware and software architecture design of the platform,
              - Setup tools to automate platform management, mainly
                via __Ansible__ to:
                  - Deploy the virtualized platform (OpenStack),
                  - Deploy and configure containerization and orchestration
                    tools, such as __Docker__, __Rancher__, __Kubernetes__,
              - Evaluation of different monitoring systems and setup prototype
                of the platform monitoring using __Prometheus__, __Grafana__
                and the __Elastic Stack__,
              - Write technical documentation using __MkDocs__.


            In parallel with those activities, I contributed to the setup of
            tooling for __Continuous Integration__ (CI), such as:


              - Automatic provisioning and deployment of __Gitlab
                Runners__,
              - Setup of standard CI jobs around various CNRS projects for
                instance to deploy automatically documentation, run tests and
                linters.


            I also offered internal training in the laboratory about __Git__
            and about data security (__gpg__, __KeepassXC__, Hard Drive
            Encryption).

            ##### Description {.subtitle}

            Realization of a __research project__ associated to the __ANR
            SoLSTiCE project__ aiming to develop new models and tools to
            represent 2D (images) and 2D+t (videos, cellular automata) data.


            During that time, I went from almost zero knowledge on the subject
            of data mining to the implement of new algorithm which I compared
            to the current state-of-the-art.


            This project led me to my thesis defense called
            __Spatio-temporal grid mining applied to image classification and
            cellular automata analysis__.

            ##### Responsibilities {.subtitle}

            The main activities I had were:

              - __Development__ of tools and algorithm to perform grid mining,
                which is a subset of graph mining,
              - __Plan__ and perform data experimentations,
              - Reading and understanding of many research papers on the subject,
              - __Autonomous work__.
